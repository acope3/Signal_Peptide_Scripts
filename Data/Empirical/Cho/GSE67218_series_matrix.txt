!Series_summary	"In order to understand the impact of fitness effect on genome evolution, we measured gene expression level by directional RNA-seq of E. coli grown at 37 ℃ in LB media because it is known that gene expression level has correlation with sequence evolution rate (Koonin & Wolf, 2006)."
!Series_overall_design	"Directional RNA-seq (dUTP method by TruSeq®) were generated  in duplicates by using Illumina MiSeq"
!Series_type	"Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing"
